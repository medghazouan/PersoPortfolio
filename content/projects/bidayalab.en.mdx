## Overview

Short TL;DR about the project (1–2 paragraphs).
What BIDAYALAB is, what the chatbot does, and your role.

## Problem

Explain the initial state: existing website with build issues, need for an intelligent chatbot,
constraints (time, stack, hosting).

## Solution

Describe the architecture: where the chatbot lives, how RAG is wired (retriever, embeddings, vector store),
how it connects to the frontend, how you fixed the build/deploy pipeline.

## Results

Concrete outcomes: site deployed successfully, chatbot responds with relevant answers,
reduced manual support, etc.

## Learnings & next steps

What you learned technically (RAG design, deployment debugging) and what you'd improve later.
