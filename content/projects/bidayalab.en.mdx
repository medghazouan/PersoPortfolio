## Overview

BIDAYALAB is a digital agency website where I was responsible for fixing production build issues
and integrating an AI-powered chatbot based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

The goal was to make the site stable in production and provide a chatbot that could answer
questions using the agency’s own content instead of generic answers.

## Problem

- The existing site had build errors that blocked deployment to production.
- The client wanted a chatbot that could answer questions about services and content, without exposing internal systems.
- The solution needed to be maintainable and not slow down the main site.

## Solution

**Architecture**

- Set up a RAG pipeline with:
  - Document ingestion and chunking.
  - Embeddings stored in a vector database.
  - A retriever + LLM that generates answers grounded in the retrieved chunks.
- Exposed the chatbot via an API endpoint and integrated it on the frontend as a chat widget.

**Implementation highlights**

- Fixed build errors by reviewing dependencies, environment variables, and build scripts until the site deployed successfully.
- Implemented the chat UI in React, calling the RAG backend endpoint for each user message.
- Added basic loading/error states and constraints on message length to keep the UX smooth.

## Results

- The site now builds and deploys correctly to production.
- The chatbot can answer questions using the agency’s content instead of generic LLM answers.
- The client can demo the chatbot live on their own website.

## Learnings & next steps

- Learned how to debug production build issues and environment problems in a real project.
- Gained experience designing a practical RAG pipeline and integrating it into an existing site.
- Next steps: add analytics on questions asked, improve retrieval quality, and experiment with cost/latency optimizations.
