## Overview

This project is a full delivery management web application that handles orders, live tracking,
and driver management.

I built the frontend with React and the backend with Laravel + MySQL.

## Problem

- The client needed a way to manage deliveries end‑to‑end:
  - Create and track orders.
  - Assign drivers.
  - Monitor status in real time.
- Existing tools were manual (spreadsheets, messages) and hard to follow.

## Solution

**Architecture**

- Frontend: React SPA for dashboards and forms.
- Backend: Laravel API with authentication, business logic, and MySQL database.
- Data model: orders, customers, drivers, delivery status, tracking events.

**Implementation highlights**

- Built React screens for:
  - Creating and editing orders.
  - Listing orders with filters (status, date, driver).
  - Viewing order details and status timeline.
- Implemented Laravel routes/controllers for:
  - CRUD operations on orders and drivers.
  - Status updates and tracking events.
- Set up MySQL schema and relationships (orders ↔ drivers, etc.).
- Added basic real-time updates using polling or lightweight push mechanism.

## Results

- The app centralizes orders, drivers, and statuses in a single interface.
- It makes it easier to see which deliveries are pending, in progress, or completed.
- The stack (React + Laravel + MySQL) is familiar for many teams, so it’s easy to maintain.

## Learnings & next steps

- Strengthened full‑stack skills: designing DB schemas and APIs that match the UI.
- Practiced handling data consistency and status transitions across frontend and backend.
- Next steps: better real‑time tracking, role‑based permissions, and more detailed analytics.
