## Overview

ARCA (AI Regulatory Compliance Agent) is a multi-agent system designed to analyze regulatory documents
and detect inconsistencies with internal company policies.

I worked on the AI and backend side: RAG pipeline design, agents coordination, and API exposure.

## Problem

- Companies need to check if internal policies comply with complex regulations.
- Manual review is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale.
- We needed a system that could read regulations and internal documents, highlight potential conflicts,
  and be accessible via an API.

## Solution

**Architecture**

- Built a RAG pipeline:
  - Ingestion and chunking of regulations and internal policy documents.
  - Embeddings stored in FAISS for fast similarity search.
  - Retriever + LLM to generate grounded answers with relevant citations.

- Designed a multi‑agent workflow:
  - One agent focuses on understanding the regulation.
  - Another evaluates internal policies.
  - A coordinator agent compares both and flags potential inconsistencies.

**Implementation highlights**

- Implemented the API with FastAPI to expose endpoints for:
  - Uploading/refreshing documents.
  - Querying regulations.
  - Getting a compliance analysis report.
- Used LangChain to orchestrate RAG components and agent behavior.
- Added basic logging and error handling to monitor queries and failures.

## Results

- ARCA can produce a structured report highlighting where internal policies may conflict with regulations.
- The system reduces manual reading and gives a starting point for legal/compliance teams.
- The architecture is modular: new data sources or agents can be added without rewriting the core.

## Learnings & next steps

- Learned how to design multi‑agent workflows on top of a RAG backbone.
- Improved understanding of trade‑offs in document chunking, retrieval, and prompt design.
- Next steps: add a UI dashboard, better evaluation metrics, and more robust document management.
